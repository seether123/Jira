you can use AWS CodePipeline to automate the process of running your script to create an Amazon Aurora cluster from a snapshot using AWS Lambda. While AWS CodeDeploy is primarily used for code deployment, AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that can be adapted for various automation tasks.

Here's how you can set up AWS CodePipeline for this purpose:

Step 1: Create an AWS Lambda Function

Create an AWS Lambda function containing your script for creating an Amazon Aurora cluster from a snapshot. Ensure that your script is written in a way that it can be triggered by an event.

Step 2: Create an AWS CodeCommit Repository (Optional)

If your script is not already stored in a source code repository, you can create a CodeCommit repository to store your script. You can skip this step if you have your script hosted elsewhere.

Step 3: Create an AWS CodePipeline Pipeline

Open the AWS CodePipeline console.
Click on "Create pipeline."
Configure your pipeline:
Pipeline name: Provide a name for your pipeline.
Service role: Create a new service role or select an existing role with the necessary permissions for CodePipeline.
Artifact store: Choose the default artifact store or configure a custom one if needed.
Click "Next."
Step 4: Add Source Stage

In the source stage, choose your source provider, such as AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or an S3 bucket where your script is stored.
Configure the source settings and branch/tag settings as appropriate for your source provider.
Click "Next."
Step 5: Add a Build Stage (Optional)

If your script requires any pre-processing or dependencies, you can add a build stage using AWS CodeBuild. This stage can build and package your script before it's passed to the Lambda function.

Step 6: Add a Deploy Stage

In the deploy stage, choose "AWS Lambda" as the deployment provider.
Configure the deployment settings:
Action mode: Choose "Create or update a function."
Function name: Select your Lambda function.
Deployment package: Choose the source artifact from the previous stage (source or build).
Click "Next."
Step 7: Review and Create

Review the pipeline configuration and click "Create pipeline" to create your pipeline.

Step 8: Trigger Your Pipeline

You can manually trigger your pipeline to run the Lambda function and execute your script. Alternatively, you can configure CloudWatch Events to schedule pipeline executions at specific intervals, similar to running your script on a schedule.

With this setup, AWS CodePipeline automates the process of triggering your Lambda function to execute your script whenever the pipeline is run. You can also use CloudWatch Events to schedule pipeline executions according to your desired schedule.
