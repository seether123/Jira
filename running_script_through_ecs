To run your Boto3 script within an ECS container without using custom images or repositories and have the container automatically terminated after the script execution, you can follow these simplified steps:

Create an ECS Task Definition:

Create an ECS task definition that references an existing public Docker image with Python installed. You don't need to create a custom Docker image or use ECR for this. Here's a minimal example of a task definition:

json
Copy code
{
  "family": "my-task-definition",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "my-container",
      "image": "python:3.9",
      "command": ["python", "-c", "import boto3; <your-script-here>"],
      "cpu": 256,
      "memory": 512
    }
  ]
}
Replace <your-script-here> with your actual Boto3 script code.

Create an ECS Cluster:

If you don't have an existing ECS cluster, create one using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

Create an ECS Task:

Create an ECS task using the task definition you created in step 1. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

Run the ECS Task:

Start the ECS task. It will launch a container based on the task definition, execute your Boto3 script, and then terminate. The task will automatically terminate upon script completion.

Monitoring and Logs:

You can monitor the task's progress and access its logs through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to verify that the script executed successfully.

This approach uses a standard Python image without the need for a custom Docker image or ECR repository. The Boto3 script is executed within the container, and the container is automatically removed after the script completes its execution.
